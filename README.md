# 7d2dSkillsMod
A skill system mod for 7 days to die game

This mod adds a rough approximation of a skill system to the game. It works by crafting the recipe books instead of looting them - meaning, you can choose what to craft instead of relying on RNG. To ensure cratfs are unlocked gradually, new items are addded. They're called tokens, and are looted from zombies, dafes and bookcases. These tokens are then used to craft books.
